## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Detect faces using MediaPipe
- âœ… Anonymize faces by:
  - Gaussian Blur
  - Pixelation
- âœ… Support for:
  - Static Images
  - Video Files
  - Webcam Feed

**ðŸ§  How It Works**
- Face Detection: Uses MediaPipe's lightweight face detection model to identify faces in the frame.

- Anonymization: Each detected face region is either blurred using a Gaussian kernel or pixelated using resizing techniques.

- Output: Processed frames are displayed live and optionally saved.
